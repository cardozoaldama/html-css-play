    <!-- You could have "block" or "inline" in every web page. -->
    <!-- Each HTML element has their own display (block or inline) by default. -->
    <!-- h1 element is a block element -->
    <h1>Headings Are Block Elements</h1>
    <!-- Blocks are giants, they create a new line for their neighbors. -->
    <!-- Also, blocks have their width 100% in their parent... -->
    <!-- Their height is always depend of their content. -->

    <!-- Those &lt; and &gt are < and > respectively. -->
    <!-- p element is a block element, but em and strong are inline elements. -->
    <p>Paragraphs are blocks, too. <em>However</em>, &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;
       elements are not. They are <strong>inline</strong> elements.</p>
    <!-- The INLINE doesn't affect the "vertical spacing", they exist only for styling stuff. I like it. -->
    <!-- The INLINE width it depends of its content, no for the parent. -->

    <!-- You too, p element. You are display: block; by default. -->
    <p>Block elements define the flow of the HTML document, while inline elements
       do not.</p>
