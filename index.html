            <p class="description">In this web site I will show you how to play with your HTML and CSS, or rather how to use your stuff and play with them. Just kidding, I do not know how because you are free to do whatever you want and whatever you need... Feel free to explore and do so. This page and its pages will change without you even notice it!</p>
